A vanilla friendly chisel mod that essentially allows any vanilla chisel pattern, (and two or three custom ones), to be applied to any block with a 'chiseled' variant, in the form of specially crafted chisels. Chiseled blocks can then have any vanilla mineral inset into them, both for flair, and in the case of redstone, glowstone, and copper, actual functionality. 
The three special patterns include some of the old powerup patterns from Super Mario World and Mario 3, (with an Earthbound easter egg for good measure), the old Mojang dragon, and various Hermit heads, in chiseled block form. The rarest chisels are quite expensive, making the more elaborate flairs, (appropriately), harder to come by.
Because I'm great at structuring systems and whatnot, literally every combination of chiseled blocks has its own custom texture. No one needs to know how long this took.
